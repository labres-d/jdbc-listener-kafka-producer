# JDBC Listener for Kafka Producer
This project addresses a common challenge faced by applications transitioning from JDBC or JPA connections to an event-driven architecture with Kafka. By leveraging JDBC listeners, the project streamlines the process of generating events when an object undergoes changes in the persistence layer, eliminating the need to manually create Kafka Producers for individual entities.
